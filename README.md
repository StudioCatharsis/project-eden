##STORY

__Setting__: Post apocalypse, a bit into the future (18 years from now).
__Plot__:
  Year 2016, the world experienced the apocalypse, where everything that is living is destroyed by natural calamities. On the third night of the apocalypse, a enormous tower suddenly appeared in the middle of the city. Creatures resembling white emotionless angels emerged from the tower.
The people consisted of what's left of society banded together and formed a military force that forced their way into the tower and eventually conquered the first 3 floors of the tower

18 years after, a group of orphans are adopted hy the military organization White Hall (the same people who invaded the tower). They orphans were trained and educated in cokbat and knowledge about the angels. The organization is also backed up by researchers trying to learn about their current predicament.
The orphans, now equipped and trained well, are given the task of leading the exploration of the higher levels of the tower.

They faced different kinds of angels and arch-angels. Everything felt like they are waging a war against the heavens, against god.

Eventually, they slowly learned of their past. That they are artifically created humans, breeded from the dna of a human and an angel. This also leads to the discovery of a human-like angel known as Adam.

One of the orphans, Eve, was created from the dna of Adam, and is the only succesful orphan created by Dr. Genesis. It is to be revealed that Adam is the first angel and the tower is his ship that descended on earth. Adam desperately searches for Eve and when he found her, kidnapped her and tried to reproduce with Eve. This act triggered the creation of The True Being through Eve.

The last bit to the puzzle is that the angels are not the biblical angels that we know. The angels are celestial beings, aliens from another planet that is trying to create a new beginning from their dying race. Earth is their new found home and has conducted many attempts on prolonging their race. When they failed, they erase all past failures and create another batch of new, better generations of angels.
